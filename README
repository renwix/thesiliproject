...keeheehee...

This directory contains theSiliProject, a humorous software
organization, design and development toolkit.

There is little funny in software development anymore. Source should
be fun to read and write. So, just to keep us all amused (and on toes)
this is written in Perl (which will really only make any sense after
reading Mark Jason Dominus' Higher Order Perl. And even then... No
matter, the point is to chuckle to yourself while reading the stack.

More seriously, it is the first stages of a thingy I found on the web
a while ago, but has gone missing... an RDF/OWL interpreter written in
lisp (or scheme). It was a clever implementation for several reasons,
but primarily because it borowed the concepts of OWL, but implemented
them in s-expressions and some small, lightweight, recursive
helpers. This project is along those lines too, but uses Perl's block
structure, which should be a little more familiar to the average hack,
especially when run through Data::Dumper.

I use it for managing 10^100 different code lines, but I started
wondering lately if the same trick couldn't be applied to browser
"profiles". Manage different browsing profiles, so that, for example,
when I go to http://news.google.com I might get my recommended stories
from one profile, and the general page from a different profile. All
without leaving my browser... But - that will have to be for a
different project.
