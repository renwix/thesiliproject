* 2008/10 : defineClass doc parser

  Now that the docs for a class are defined in an internal DSL in a
  src .pm file, we need a way to extract that information and make it
  available as pod. The docs are already in metadata in the class (or
  is that another enhancement?), so it should be possible to generate
  an output file that contains both the inline pod doc and the
  generated class structure pod info.

* 2008/10 : more tests

  This one will never end, I'm sure.
