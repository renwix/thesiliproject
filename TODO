* 2008/12 : defineScript 

  wrap getopts, expand the vars into ::main and assert on existence
  as necessary. Shouldn't require any preprocessor or anything like
  that.

* 2008/11 : DB create/management tools

  Since the information is now in metadata, it should be simple to
  create a sili compiler that will convert db schema declarations into
  sql execution scripts. It might even be possible to derive sql
  scripts based on model comparisons across versions.

  Need Pg support out the gates, and ORA might be nice too.

* 2008/10 : defineClass doc parser

  Now that the docs for a class are defined in an internal DSL in a
  src .pm file, we need a way to extract that information and make it
  available as pod. The docs are already in metadata in the class (or
  is that another enhancement?), so it should be possible to generate
  an output file that contains both the inline pod doc and the
  generated class structure pod info.

* 2008/10 : more tests

  This one will never end, I'm sure.
